About Hermes
-----------------

Hermes is a free C++ library for rapid development of
adaptive *hp*-FEM and *hp*-DG solvers for partial differential equations (PDE)
and multiphysics PDE systems. The development team now includes mostly the department of Theory of Electrical Engineering at the University of West Bohemia in Pilsen (contact: korous@rice.zcu.cz), in the past the main development was done by the `hp-FEM group <http://hpfem.org/hermes>`_ at the `University of Nevada, Reno <http://www.unr.edu>`_.
Information about further collaborators from numerous places around the globe can be found at `<http://www.hpfem.org/citing/>`_.

A standard way to use Hermes is to write short C++ user programs 
that use the functionality provided by the library, but for 
those who prefer to use a graphical interface, the group located at the 
University of West Bohemia also develops a graphical Engineering tool based on Hermes2D: 
`Agros2D <http://agros2d.org/>`_.
